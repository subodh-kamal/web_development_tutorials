### There are two types of executable files:
1. Script executable file.
2. Binary executable file.

Any file that has given the executable permission is called executable file. And by default, Windows files are given the executable permission.
For eg: if we create a file named hello.txt and write pwd inside this file and run the file in terminal like: ./hello.txt then this will run the pwd command. Because this file is executable file and it executes by itself. And these are SCRIPT EXECUTABLE FILE because we are writing some scripts in these files.

- Linux/Unix also has binary executable files but their extention is not .exe

- All executable files of Ubuntu is present in the directory named usr then bin
